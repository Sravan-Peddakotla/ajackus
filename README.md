## 🧠 Reflection

### Challenges Faced
- Creating a modular layout that works without backend support
- Managing data updates (edit/delete) purely in memory

### What Could Be Improved
- (Improved) Now includes localStorage to persist data across refreshes
- Integration with a backend (Spring Boot/Freemarker) for full-stack setup
